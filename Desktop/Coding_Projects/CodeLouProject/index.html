    <ul>
        <li>A fake fortune teller website that had multiple pages, including a contact page and random response generator.</li>
        <li>Travel site for Fallout 3 that compares the real locations for fictional in-game places. I think someone may have had a similar idea already and I don't want to steal it. Need to check.</li>
        <li>Portfolio site of my own artwork. Not a bad idea because I want to make one anyway.</li>
        <li>Fake cult site. I think this could be a really fun seudo-AR experience kind of thing. Base it on Elder Scrolls lore.</li>
